## Nomo Challenge

All requirements covered

Extra Points:

ES6, Redux, Format Date

Just one unit test, time is always a constraint

No possibility to do sorting (hot, new, controversial). I could not find any property with these values

## Scan QR Code

[Lets go to Scan QR Code](https://expo.io/@ialberdic/nomo-banking-challenge)

## Installation

yarn install (Please, be aware npm install may not work properly)

If you face any issue; remove yarn.lock and node_modules then yarn install

## Trouble

Created at property has changed the format suddenly from today Thursday on 6th June. Yesterday, it worked like a charm.

I will have a look later
